This project is a submission for Frontend Developer Assessment: Management System Dashboard.

it uses [jsonplaceholder ](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for the data

Unfortuantly that site does not allow data maniplation , so the editing, deleting or creating functionallity doesn't do anything. To check the request open the dev tools and check the network tab

the pages
1. User profile page : click on a user card in the user listing page or a user's tag in the posts listing page
2. User listing page : found in the user tab in the nav. shows a list of users. 
3. Dashboard:  found in the dashboard tab in the nav. has the 2 specified graphes with the ability to choose the post. all the posts have 5 unique commenters so neither graph can change 
4. Post listing page :  found in the posts tab in the nav. shows a list of post with user filitering and a search bar. 
5. Post detail page + comments : click on the check comments button in the posts listing page
6. Navigation Bar/Menu to navigate between pages: nav bar found on the side on desktop and bottom on mobile


I used chart js for the dashboard and made sure the design is functional even on mobile

you can search posts titles using the search bar and filter by users (the menu )

the site speed was not slow so I didn't add paganation to keep the code simple.
